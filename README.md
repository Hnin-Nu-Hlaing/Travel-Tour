 ## Challenge

 ### Git Merge Conflict Resolution Challenge

 - During the Git challenge, when a team member pushed changes to the global repository, I had to merge those changes with my main branch, which resulted in some code not appearing as expected, but we successfully resolved the conflicts.

 ## Copyright

 - In our research project, we explored copyright laws and responsibly used images from two websites, ensuring we respected the rights of creators.
